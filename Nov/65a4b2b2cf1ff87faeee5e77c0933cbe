Ugandan police say suicide bombers carried out twin attacks near the capital's central police station and parliament Tuesday. Three civilians were killed and 33 others were injured in the attacks. The bombers exploded their devices at three minutes past ten in the morning and six minutes past ten respectively. Police spokesperson Fred Enanga said the first attack, involving one bomber, was at the Kampala Central Police station check point, while the second attack, involving two bombers, was along Parliament Avenue. "We are seeing a lot of bodies scattered," he said. "Legs have been scattered and there’s a skull which we believe are for the suicide bomber who attacked the police station at CPS. Then there are also other bodies that have been scattered at the scene, between Raja chambers and Jubilee insurance." Police are blaming the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group for the attacks. "The hallmarks of the attack clearly indicate that the ADF-linked radicalized groups who still have a desire to carryout lethal attacks on soft targets, using suicide attackers and improvised explosive devices, are behind these attacks," Enanga said. All roads within Kampala’s central business district have been cordoned off, and offices and businesses premises have been closed. A fourth suicide attacker only identified as Mozey was also pursued, shot and disabled, according to police. Enanga said officers searched Mozey’s home, where they recovered an unexploded suicide jacket and other related explosive devices. Two other suicide bombings in the capital late last month injured a total of six people. Calling for public vigilance, Enanga warned that radicalized groups are an active threat, especially from suicide attackers.
