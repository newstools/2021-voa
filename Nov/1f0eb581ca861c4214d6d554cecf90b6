U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visits Kenya Wednesday to discuss "the partnership" between the two countries and to address regional issues such as ending the violence in Ethiopia, combating terrorism in Somalia and reviving Sudan's transition to a civilian government, the State Department said Tuesday. Kenya, a member of the United Nations Security Council, is an important player in Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia. The State Department said Blinken will meet with President Uhuru Kenyatta and Foreign Affairs Ambassador Raychelle Omamo to discuss the partnerships between their governments with respect to "ending the COVID pandemic and investing in health, addressing the climate crisis, building a more inclusive global economy, and strengthening democracy and respect for human rights." The agency said the U.S. and Kenya are also "working together to address regional priorities, particularly ending the crisis in Ethiopia, fighting terrorism in Somalia, and restoring the civilian-led transition in Sudan." Blinken's upcoming visit to Kenya is part of a three-nation tour to Africa that also includes trips to Nigeria and Senegal. His trip is partially aimed at raising America's profile as a key player in the region as it competes with China. Despite its large contributions of money and vaccines to contain the coronavirus and other infectious diseases, the U.S. has had little success in gaining influence in the region.
