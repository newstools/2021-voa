Bomb threats at three Ivy League college campuses caused evacuations and police investigations Sunday, with at least two schools saying the threats there were unfounded. Cornell, Columbia and Brown universities alerted students to the threats. Authorities at Columbia and Brown said campus buildings had been cleared Sunday evening. In Ithaca, New York, Cornell police cordoned off the center of campus on Sunday after receiving a call that bombs were placed in four buildings. In New York City, Columbia University police issued a campuswide emergency alert after receiving bomb threats at university buildings about 2:30 p.m. The university deemed the threats not credible shortly before 5 p.m. Brown University officials in Providence, Rhode Island, sent a text alert to students that said police were investigating "multiple buildings on campus involving a bomb threat. Later in the evening, the university issued another alert before 6 p.m. that said students were safe to resume activity on campus. The threats came two days after a bomb threat at Yale University forced the evacuation of several buildings as well as nearby businesses in New Haven, Connecticut. Yale's campus resumed normal activities Friday evening, roughly five hours after the call was received.
