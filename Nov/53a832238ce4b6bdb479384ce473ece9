White House officials say more than 90 percent of all U.S. federal workers have received at least one dose of COIVD-19 vaccine by the Monday deadline set by U.S. President Joe Biden. In September, Biden announced all federal workers were required to be vaccinated by November 22, with no test-out option, unless they secured an approved medical or religious exemption. Workers who failed to comply by the Monday deadline will begin a “counseling” process that could ultimately result in their termination if they remain unvaccinated without securing an approved exception to vaccination. White House Assistant Press Secretary Kevin Munoz tweeted Monday that 95 percent of all US government employees are in compliance with Biden’s vaccination requirement. He added, “There are no disruptions related to the requirement; we’ll avoid COVID-related disruptions through vaccinations.” Already 95% of USG employees are in compliance with the President’s vax requirement. There are no disruptions related to the requirement; we’ll avoid COVID-related disruptions through vaccinations. Today isn’t a cliff and we’ll be working with employees. https://t.co/BSHWzlEODQ Department of Homeland Security Assistant Public Affairs Secretary Marsha (Catron) Espinoza also tweeted Monday that 98 percent of U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees and 93 percent of all Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees are “in compliance” with the vaccine mandate rules. Biden administration officials told Reuters news agency the final numbers will change as employees continue to submit documentation until the deadline, later Monday, and as all employee submissions may not yet have been processed. However, the figures suggest that potentially 175,000 federal employees may not be vaccinated and are not yet in compliance with the rules. Some information for this report comes from The Associated Press and Reuters.
