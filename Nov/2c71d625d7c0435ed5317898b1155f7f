Prosecutors in Waukesha, Wisconsin, charged a man with five counts of intentional homicide Tuesday for the five people killed when he allegedly rammed an SUV into a Christmas parade Sunday. A sixth person, a child, has died, and prosecutors from the Waukesha County District Attorney's Office said more charges are pending. Sixty-two people were injured. The suspect, 39-year-old Darrell Brooks of Milwaukee, could be heard crying during the proceedings, according to The Associated Press. If convicted, he faces a mandatory life sentence on each count. District Attorney Sue Opper has not indicated what additional charges she may file. On Monday, Waukesha Police Department Chief Dan Thompson said that police had no motive for the attack and no evidence that Sunday night's crash in the Milwaukee suburb was related to terrorism. Police said it happened minutes after the suspect had been involved in a domestic disturbance, but officers were not in pursuit of him at the time. Video from the scene shows the red SUV driving into the parade route as the parade is under way, striking a marching band and other participants from behind without slowing down. Four women, whose ages ranged from 52 to 79, and an 81-year-old man were killed in the incident on Sunday. A local Milwaukee television station, citing police and court sources, said Brooks was released on Friday from jail after posting bail for earlier charges, including battery and disorderly conduct. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.
