Please send us your prayers. We are excited to walk together for the journey ahead," she added. A nikkah ceremony is the first step in an Islamic marriage. When she was 15, Yousafzai was shot in the head by militants from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, an offshoot of the Afghan Taliban, in her home town in the Swat valley while on a school bus in 2012. She recovered after months of treatment at home and abroad before co-writing a best-selling memoir titled "I am Malala." Yousafzai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as a 17-year-old in 2014, sharing the award with Kailash Satyarthi, a children's rights activist from India. She graduated last year from the University of Oxford with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics. Now 24 years old, she advocates for girls' education, with her non-profit Malala Fund having invested $2 million in Afghanistan. She has also signed a deal with Apple TV+ that will see her produce dramas and documentaries that focus on women and children.
