Steve Bannon, the former adviser and longtime ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump, surrendered to federal authorities Monday in Washington after being indicted on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress. In the news video taken as he arrived at FBI headquarters, Bannon spoke into cameras as he walked into the building. The Reuters news service reported that he livestreamed his surrender. CNN reported that Brannon defiantly told reporters, “We are taking down the Biden regime,” just before entering the building. The U.S. Justice Department last week indicted the 67-year-old Bannon on two counts of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the U.S. House of Representatives’ select committee investigating the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6. One count of the indictment refers to his refusal to appear before the committee for a deposition, and the second for not providing documents in response to the committee's subpoena. If found guilty, Bannon faces a minimum of 30 days and up to a year in jail. He is expected to make an initial court appearance later Monday. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the indictments show the department's "steadfast commitment" to ensuring that the rule of law is enforced. On Friday, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows defied a similar subpoena from the committee.
