Thousands of Sudanese demonstrators rallied in the capital, Khartoum, and other parts of the country Monday to protest the country's October military coup. Demonstrators said police fired tear gas to disperse protesters marching near the presidential palace. The Associated Press reported that protests also took place Monday in cities outside the capital, including Kassala, Sennar and Port Sudan. Sudan's military took power on October 25, arresting dozens of officials in the country's transitional government. It was the second coup in the country since a popular uprising in April 2019 forced the removal of longtime leader Omar al-Bashir. Sudan's top general, Abdel Fattah Burhan, initially detained Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok but was forced to reinstate him in November following mass protests and international condemnation of the coup. Sudan's pro-democracy movement has rejected the deal that put Hamdok back in the prime minister seat, saying a fully civilian government should be in power. Protest organizers said Monday they were demonstrating with the slogan "No negotiations, no compromise, no power-sharing" with the military. In other developments Monday, the Sudan Doctors Committee said the death toll from fighting over the weekend in Sudan's western Darfur region climbed to 48. The tribal violence took place in the Kreinik area. Darfur has seen decades of instability and rebellion. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.
