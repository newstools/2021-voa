Law enforcement officials in Oakland County, Michigan, on Wednesday said a 17-year-old boy has died from wounds suffered in a school shooting at Oxford High School the day before, becoming the fourth student killed in the incident. The Oakland County Sheriff's Office confirmed that 17-year-old Justin Shilling died early Wednesday from his injuries. They said the other victims included Tate Myre, 16; Hana St. Juliana, 14; and Madisyn Baldwin, 17. Several others were injured in the shooting, including a teacher. Police arrested 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, a sophomore at the high school in a community about 48 kilometers north of Detroit. Police say the entire incident Tuesday took place in about five minutes, with the suspect surrendering to police as they encountered him in a hallway of the school. They said he was carrying a semi-automatic 9 mm handgun that was loaded with seven rounds of ammunition. Law enforcement officials say Crumbley fired as many as 30 shots, some at close range, before he surrendered. Oakland County Sheriff Mike Bouchard told a news conference later that the suspect's father purchased the handgun four days before the incident. The sheriff said that the suspect was not cooperating and no motive for the shooting had been determined. On Wednesday, Crumbley was charged as an adult, with one count of terrorism causing death, four counts of first-degree murder and seven counts of assault with intent to murder, said Oakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.
