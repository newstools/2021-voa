Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian assailant running toward them with a knife Friday at a bus station in the occupied West Bank, the army said. Citing an initial investigation, it said in a statement the man had arrived at a junction near the Jewish settlement of Ariel in a car, got out and "armed with a knife, ran toward the bus station where civilians and IDF soldiers were standing."
The Palestinian health ministry identified the dead man as a resident of Qarawet Bani Hassan, a nearby village. The Israeli army said it was pursuing whoever else was in the vehicle, which had fled the scene. The West Bank has seen sporadic violence since U.S.-sponsored talks on founding a Palestinian state alongside Israel stalled in 2014.
