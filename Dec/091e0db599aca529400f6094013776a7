Libyan journalist Abdelhafid al-Mogassbi, who was kidnapped five weeks ago by unknown gunmen in the country's second city Benghazi, said Thursday he has been released. Mogassbi, who was seized on November 22 from the offices of his newspaper Al-Hayat, told AFP he was freed on Wednesday and was in "good" health, but gave no details of his detention or release. According to the government media authority, unknown assailants had entered the Al-Hayat offices "threatening" employees and seized Mogassbi. They refused to show identification or an arrest warrant or to explain their action, said the Benghazi branch of the authority, which shares offices with Al-Hayat. Libya has been ravaged by violence and insecurity ever since a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed dictator Moamer Kadhafi in 2011. Media professionals paid a heavy price in the revolt as well as the chaos that has followed, with several Libyan and foreign journalists attacked or kidnapped. Libya is ranked 165 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index by media watchdog Reporters Without Borders.
