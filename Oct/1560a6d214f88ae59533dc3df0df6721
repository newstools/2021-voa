A suspected drone attack hit an outpost in southern Syria on Wednesday that is used by U.S. forces. Captain Bill Urban, a U.S. Central Command spokesman, called the attack “deliberate and coordinated.” "Based on initial reports, the attack utilized both unmanned aerial systems and indirect fire," he said. U.S. officials said there were no American injuries or deaths. The attack happened at the Al-Tanf base located in Syria near the border with Iraq and Jordan. The site was set up as part of the effort to defeat Islamic State. Some information for this report came from the Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, and Reuters.
