An eighth man, who allegedly conspired with the leader of the group, was also charged with federal crimes linked to internet scams stemming from South Africa, the Secret Service said. The Secret Service statement said the following people were charged wire fraud, money laundering and other crimes in connection with perpetrating romance scams and other illegal schemes perpetrated on victims in the U.S. and other countries between 2011 and 2021 using the internet:

Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael Honig said in the statement that "Americans are too often victimized by criminal organizations located abroad that use the internet to deceive those victims, defraud them of money, and, many times, persuade their victims to wittingly or unwittingly assist in perpetuating the fraudulent schemes." "The public should be on guard against schemes like these," she added. "And, more importantly, anyone thinking of engaging in this kind of criminal conduct should understand that the U.S. Attorney's Office and our partners will find them and bring them to justice, no matter where they are." The statement said: "The wire fraud conspiracy and wire fraud charges each carry a maximum term of 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. The money laundering conspiracy charge carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction, whichever is greatest. The aggravated identity theft charges carry a mandatory term of two years in prison, which must run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed on a defendant."
