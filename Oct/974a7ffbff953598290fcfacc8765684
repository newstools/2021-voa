Noted Russian journalist Sergei Reznik, who specializes in anti-corruption investigations, has been added to the Interior Ministry’s wanted list. Reznik's name was added to the wanted list over the weekend, local media reported. He is thought to be living outside of Russia. No details for his placement on the list were provided, though some media reports cited law enforcement sources as saying that Reznik is wanted for the alleged "justification of Nazism." The accusation stems from unspecified social-media posts that appeared on accounts suspected of being connected to him, they added. In 2013, Reznik, who is from the Rostov region, was sentenced to 18 months in prison on charges of bribery and publicly insulting an official representative of the authorities. Later, he was sentenced to another 18 months in prison after a court found him guilty of false denunciation. Reznik maintained his innocence and continued to work as an investigative journalist after serving the prison terms. He says that a total of seven criminal cases have been opened against him with all of the alleged victims being prosecutors, judges, or police officials. He also claims that over the past year, 15 statements from people in the Krasnodar region were submitted to the police and the prosecutor's office against him and three of his colleagues.
