After a 10-month investigation, law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe have arrested at least 150 people suspected of drug trafficking over the darknet, the U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday. Officials also seized over $31 million in cash and cryptocurrency and 45 guns. The darknet is a part of the internet that is accessible only by using specialized anonymity tools such as the Tor browser. The Justice Department said those arrested were involved in tens of thousands of illegal online drug sales in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Sixty-five Americans were among those arrested, along with 47 Germans and 25 British citizens, Dutch media reported. “The point of operations such as the one today is to put criminals operating on the dark web on notice: The law enforcement community has the means and global partnerships to unmask them and hold them accountable for their illegal activities, even in areas of the dark web,” Jean-Philippe Lecouffe, Europol’s deputy executive director of operations, said in a statement.
